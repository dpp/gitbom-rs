# gitbom-rs
"An experimental implementation of GitBOM in Rust"

**NOTICE: This project is still a work in progress and is not ready for any use beyond experimental**

## What is GitBOM?

To quote [the GitBOM website](https://gitbom.dev/):

```
GitBOM is a minimalistic scheme for build tools to:
1. Build a compact artifact tree, tracking every source code file incorporated into each build artifact
2. Embed a unique, content addressable reference for that artifact tree, the GitBOM identifier, into the artifact at build time
```

For information, see [the website](https://gitbom.dev/) and the [list of GitBOM resources](https://gitbom.dev/resources/)

## What is gitbom-rs?

gitbom-rs is an experimental implementation of gitBOM in Rust. This is an important learning exercise and will inform future implementations of gitBOM in the future (both in Rust and in other languages)
